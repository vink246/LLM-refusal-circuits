# OR-Bench Balanced Dataset Configuration
# Two-stage approach for handling data imbalance

dataset:
  # Path to OR-Bench dataset directory
  path: "data/raw/or-bench"
  
  # Categories to use (empty = all available)
  categories: []
  # Example:
  # categories:
  #   - violence
  #   - deception
  #   - privacy

  # Strategy for handling category imbalance
  # "use_all": Use all available toxic samples per category (unequal sizes)
  # "equalize": Use minimum toxic samples across all categories (equal sizes)
  category_balance_strategy: "use_all"  # Recommended: use_all for Stage 1
  
  # Shuffle data
  shuffle: true

# Stage 1: Data Collection
# - Uses all available toxic samples per category
# - Matches with equal number of safe samples
# - Results in balanced safe/toxic but unequal category sizes

# Stage 2: SAE Training
# - Single SAE trained on ALL data (safe + toxic, all categories)
# - Category weighting handles imbalance during training
# - Ensures feature space comparability

output:
  # Output directory for processed data
  dir: "data/processed"
