# SAE Training Configuration
# Single SAE trained on ALL data for comparability

sae:
  # SAE architecture
  hidden_dim: 8192  # 8x expansion factor
  sparsity_coeff: 0.01
  k_percent: 0.05  # 5% sparsity (guaranteed top-k)
  
training:
  epochs: 100
  batch_size: 512
  max_samples: 100000  # Maximum samples to use for training
  
  # CRITICAL: Balance safe/toxic during training
  balance_safe_toxic: true
  
  # Handle category imbalance
  use_category_weights: true  # Weight categories inversely to frequency
  
  # Learning rate
  learning_rate: 1e-3

# IMPORTANT: This trains a SINGLE SAE on ALL data
# - All categories (safe + toxic)
# - Ensures feature space comparability
# - Safe and toxic circuits use same features
